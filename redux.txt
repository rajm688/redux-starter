1. redux is a state management library for javascript applications
2. can be  used in js, react,angular,vue etc,.
3. eg: in fb when we change our profile pic. it will be updated in all our post. 
4. mainly build based on functional programming where variables are immmutable
5. three main things in redux
    * reducer -> takes the current instance  of the value and returns the updated one
        * reducer contains two things
            * state -> which is the instance of the variable
            * action ->js object which describes what just happened. it tells reducer which property of the value to be changed
6. Store which stores all the state in one place

6. view (UI) ---> Action(dispatches action obj) ---> store <---> Reducer(updates value based on action annd returns updated value to store)
